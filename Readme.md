# Api-with-FacturaApi
This is the developent of an simple application form made with nodejs, express, jwt, react, redux toolkit

# Installation 
```
    Terminal 1: cd back && yarn install && yarn start
    Terminal 2: cd front && yarn install && yarn start
```


# Considerations 
- This was a simple application to manage a simple crud application made with node js and Express
- The front is made with react combined of styles component. The api states were managed with redux toolkit. I also implemented a basic system security with JWT.
